For VHDL compilation, create a "VHDL Program" class. For each VHDL class, it has
a list of component objects it requires. 

Component classes have static "Compile entity" funcitons which compiles the
class into a VHDL entity

Compilation of VHDL Programs:

First Pass: 
    Compile the entities required by the program

Second Pass:
    Compile behavior into component interfaces and component instances
